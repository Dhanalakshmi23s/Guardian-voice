The A Comprehensive Speech Safeguard System for Ensuring Ethical Conversations in Social Media Audio Interactions is a comprehensive framework designed to enhance the security, privacy, and responsible usage of audio-based interactions within social media platforms. 
It integrates various measures and technologies to address concerns such as user privacy, content moderation, data security, policy enforcement, and regulatory compliance. 
Through advanced speech recognition, content analysis, and moderation tools, this system aims to create a secure and respectful environment for social media users. 
By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms during the conversion of text to speech, the project ensures accurate interpretation and safeguarding of audio content, thereby promoting responsible user behavior and fostering a trustworthy online community.
